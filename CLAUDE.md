# Meroka — Healthcare Intelligence Platform

Meroka is a market-making platform enabling direct contracting between independent medical practices and self-insured employers — bypassing traditional insurance networks. The core thesis: independent practices deliver equal or better care at significantly lower cost than hospital-affiliated and PE-owned practices, but lack the infrastructure to contract directly with employers. Meroka provides that infrastructure.

The interactive wireframe (`meroka-wireframe-v2.html`) maps the full data pipeline: 30+ public and private data sources → AWS S3 Data Lake → Data Warehouse (70+ fields) → Products.

## Products

### Direct Contracting Marketplace (DCM) — External
Owner: Alex Barrett

Market-making platform for direct contracting between independent medical practices and self-insured employers. Five-layer pipeline:

- **L1: Provider Map** — Identify every independent practice, classify ownership via NPPES + PECOS + web scraping
- **L2: Services & Revenue** — What each practice does, how much, and what they get paid (Medicare utilization + TiC negotiated rates)
- **L3: Quality Signals** — MIPS scores, CMS Care Compare, Google Business ratings, state medical board license status
- **L4: Comparison Engine** — Prove independents deliver equal or better care at lower cost. Generate headline stats for employer pitch
- **L5: Employer Contracting & Legal Agent** — Auto-generate CIN formation docs, direct employer-provider contracts, TPA coordination memos. Grounded in AKS safe harbors, Stark exceptions, ERISA, FTC CIN guidelines, state-specific compliance

Current phase: **MA Sports Medicine POC** (Feb 2026) — ~200 practices, 6 taxonomy codes, 15 target CPTs. Proves the thesis with real data for one specialty in one state.

Future phases: MA Full Specialty Expansion (Q2 2026), Multi-state Rollout — CT, NY, NJ (Q3 2026).

### Rural Health Classifier — External
Owner: Bonnie

Classify practices by Rural Health Clinic (RHC) eligibility per CMS definition:
1. Located in a non-urbanized area (Census/RUCA)
2. Within a HPSA or MUA (HRSA)
3. CLIA-certified lab for basic diagnostics
4. High Medicare/Medicaid patient share

Workflows: Rural Eligibility Classification → Shortage Area Overlay → CLIA Lab Certification Check → Payer Mix Analysis → RHC Readiness Score

### Malpha — Internal
Owner: Othmane. Coming soon.

## Architecture (DCM POC)

- **Mac Mini M4** — Always-on local compute. Runs pipelines and agents overnight. ~/meroka/ — scripts/, data/, logs/, outputs/, credentials/
- **Claude Sonnet (Anthropic API)** — Reasoning brain for web scrape classification, insights reports, legal drafting. ~$5-30/wk
- **OpenClaw Agent Framework** — Gives Claude ability to browse, run code, read/write files. Gateway port 18789, Brave relay port 18792
- **Google BigQuery** — meroka-massachusetts.sports_medicine — serverless cloud warehouse. <$1/wk
- **AWS S3 Data Lake** — Raw source files stored as Parquet via Glue ETL. Partitioned by state.
- **Outputs** — Streamlit dashboard (localhost:8501), CFO insights reports, CIN formation docs, employer contracts

Flow: Phone (Telegram) → Mac Mini → Claude API → BigQuery → Outputs

## Legal Framework

The legal model for direct contracting rests on:

1. **2021 VBC Safe Harbors** — Three new AKS safe harbors + three new Stark exceptions specifically designed for value-based arrangements. A CIN qualifies as a "value-based enterprise."
2. **ERISA Preemption** — Self-insured employer plans bypass state insurance mandates, making direct contracting legally viable.
3. **FTC Clinical Integration** — CINs are legally defensible for joint price negotiation IF they have genuine clinical integration (quality programs, utilization monitoring, shared protocols).
4. **State Law** — Each state has unique insurance regulations, TPA licensing, AG oversight. Starting with MA (8 sources mapped), expanding to CT, NY, NJ.

Legal knowledge base architecture: Source documents → S3 (s3://meroka-legal/{state}/) → PDF text extracted and chunked (~500 tokens) → vector embeddings → RAG retrieval for Claude context injection.

## State Law: Massachusetts (8 sources mapped)

1. MA AG Healthcare Division — AG jurisdiction over healthcare market consolidation
2. MA Health Policy Commission — State body reviewing consolidation, publishes cost/quality data
3. CHIA (Center for Health Info & Analysis) — All-Payer Claims Database (requires DUA)
4. Chapter 224 Cost Containment — Sets healthcare cost growth benchmark
5. MA Division of Insurance — TPA licensing, network adequacy rules
6. MA Board of Registration in Medicine — Credential verification and disciplinary history
7. MA General Laws Ch. 176D — Unfair insurance practices (TPA conduct)
8. MA General Laws Ch. 175 — Insurance licensing requirements

## Key Numbers

- Commercial insurers pay ~254% of Medicare rates (RAND study)
- 47% of physicians are now employed by hospitals (2024)
- ~6.5% of physicians are under PE ownership
- RUCA >= 4 = non-urbanized (RHC eligibility threshold)
- HPSA scores range 1-25 (higher = greater shortage)
- MIPS payment adjustments range -9% to +9%
- TiC files: single insurer can be 2+ TB of JSON
